# GradeAnalyzer
The GradeAnalyzer is a small C program that I have developed as a project 
for my BTP100 class (Introduction to Programming using C) at Seneca College during Fall 2015.
The program reads raw data from a "student.dat" file and then it displays the data in a table, 
the table is also written to a file ("analysis.dat") before the program terminates. 
After the table is displayed the program will generate a report and distribution table. 
The last part of the program consists in asking the user to input a student name 
and displaying the final grade that student received. The program terminates when the user enters 'close'.
